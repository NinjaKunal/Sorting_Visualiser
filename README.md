# Sorting_Visualiser
 

### This is my take on sorting visualiser project. Like many others, I was inspired by [Clément Mihailescu](https://github.com/clementmihailescu) to make this project. This project is made using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The sorting algorithms implemented are :-
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
